# This file lets you specify the options you want to use for various apps.
#
# Options in this file take precedence over ones in touchHLE_default_options.txt
#
# ---
#
# Each line in this file specifies options for an app; there should only be one
# line per app. A line should consist of the identifier for an app, followed by
# a colon (:), followed by the options to apply. To find out an app's
# identifier, you can run it in touchHLE and look at the “App bundle info”
# output. To get a list of possible options, see OPTIONS_HELP.txt or run
# touchHLE with the --help flag.
#
# Text on a line following a hash sign (#) is treated as a comment and ignored.
# Empty lines are also ignored.
